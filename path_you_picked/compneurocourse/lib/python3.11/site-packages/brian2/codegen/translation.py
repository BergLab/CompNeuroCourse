"""
This module translates a series of statements into a language-specific
syntactically correct code block that can be inserted into a template.

It infers whether or not a variable can be declared as
constant, etc. It should handle common subexpressions, and so forth.

The input information needed:

* The sequence of statements (a multiline string) in standard mathematical form
* The list of known variables, common subexpressions and functions, and for each
  variable whether or not it is a value or an array, and if an array what the
  dtype is.
* The dtype to use for newly created variables
* The language to translate to

    Analyses a code string (sequence of statements) to find all identifiers by type.

    In a given code block, some variable names (identifiers) must be given as inputs to the code
    block, and some are created by the code block. For example, the line::

        a = b+c

    This could mean to create a new variable a from b and c, or it could mean modify the existing
    value of a from b or c, depending on whether a was previously known.

    unknown : set

    Parameters
    ----------

        A (multi-line) string of statements.
    variables : dict-like
        A dictionary of with `Variable` and `Function` objects for every

    optimise : bool, optional
        Whether to optimise expressions, including
        pulling out loop invariant expressions and putting them in new
        scalar constants. Defaults to ``False``, since this function is also
        used just to in contexts where we are not interested by this kind of
        optimisation. For the main code generation stage, its value is set by
        the `codegen.loop_invariant_optimisations` preference.
    blockname : str, optional
        A name for the block (used to name intermediate variables to avoid
        name clashes when multiple blocks are used together)
    Returns
    -------
    scalar_statements, vector_statements : (list of `Statement`, list of `Statement`)
        Lists with statements that are to be executed once and statements that
        are to be executed once for every neuron/synapse/... (or in a vectorised
        way)

    Notes
    -----
    If ``optimise`` is ``True``, then the
    ``scalar_statements`` may include newly introduced scalar constants that
    have been identified as loop-invariant and have therefore been pulled out
    of the vector statements. The resulting statements will also use augmented
    assignments where possible, i.e. a statement such as ``w = w + 1`` will be
    replaced by ``w += 1``. Also, statements involving booleans will have
    additional information added to them (see `Statement` for details)
    describing how the statement can be reformulated as a sequence of if/then
    statements. Calls `~brian2.codegen.optimisation.optimise_statements`.
