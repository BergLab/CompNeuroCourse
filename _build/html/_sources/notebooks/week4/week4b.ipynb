When objects are represented by high-dimensional data —think for instance of cell types represented by their proteomics or stars represented by their physical properties—, then the task of clustering becomes challenging. \n",

To compensate this shortcoming, a first step when looking to cluster data is to *reduce its dimensionality*, meaning that we find some representation of the data in 2 or 3 dimension such that we obtain meaningful clusters.\n",
