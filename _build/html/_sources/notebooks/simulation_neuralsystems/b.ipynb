    "There are a few things going on here. First of all, let's recap what is going on with the ``NeuronGroup``. We've created two neurons, each of which has the same differential equation but different values for parameters I and tau. Neuron 0 has ``I=2`` and ``tau=10*ms`` which means that is driven to repeatedly spike at a fairly high rate. Neuron 1 has ``I=0`` and ``tau=100*ms`` which means that on its own - without the synapses - it won't spike at all (the driving current I is 0). You can prove this to yourself by commenting out the two lines that define the synapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we define the synapses: ``Synapses(source, target, ...)`` means that we are defining a synaptic model that goes from ``source`` to ``target``. In this case, the source and target are both the same, the group ``G``. The syntax ``on_pre='v_post += 0.2'`` means that when a spike occurs in the presynaptic neuron (hence ``on_pre``) it causes an instantaneous change to happen ``v_post += 0.2``. The ``_post`` means that the value of ``v`` referred to is the post-synaptic value, and it is increased by 0.2. So in total, what this model says is that whenever two neurons in G are connected by a synapse, when the source neuron fires a spike the target neuron will have its value of ``v`` increased by 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at this point we have only defined the synapse model, we haven't actually created any synapses. The next line ``S.connect(i=0, j=1)`` creates a synapse from neuron 0 to neuron 1."

    "This example behaves very similarly to the previous example, but now there's a synaptic weight variable ``w``. The string ``'w : 1'`` is an equation string, precisely the same as for neurons, that defines a single dimensionless parameter ``w``. We changed the behaviour on a spike to ``on_pre='v_post += w'`` now, so that each synapse can behave differently depending on the value of ``w``. To illustrate this, we've made a third neuron which behaves precisely the same as the second neuron, and connected neuron 0 to both neurons 1 and 2. We've also set the weights via ``S.w = 'j*0.2'``. When ``i`` and ``j`` occur in the context of synapses, ``i`` refers to the source neuron index, and ``j`` to the target neuron index. So this will give a synaptic connection from 0 to 1 with weight ``0.2=0.2*1`` and from 0 to 2 with weight ``0.4=0.2*2``."

    "There are a few things to see there. Firstly, when defining the synapses we've given a more complicated multi-line string defining three synaptic variables (``w``, ``apre`` and ``apost``). We've also got a new bit of syntax there, ``(event-driven)`` after the definitions of ``apre`` and ``apost``. What this means is that although these two variables evolve continuously over time, Brian should only update them at the time of an event (a spike). This is because we don't need the values of ``apre`` and ``apost`` except at spike times, and it is more efficient to only update them when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have a ``on_pre=...`` argument. The first line is ``v_post += w``: this is the line that actually applies the synaptic weight to the target neuron. The second line is ``apre += Apre`` which encodes the rule above. In the third line, we're also encoding the rule above but we've added one extra feature: we've clamped the synaptic weights between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of ``wmax`` so that the weights can't get too large or negative. The function ``clip(x, low, high)`` does this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have a ``on_post=...`` argument. This gives the statements to calculate when a post-synaptic neuron fires. Note that we do not modify ``v`` in this case, only the synaptic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how all the variables behave when a presynaptic spike arrives some time before a postsynaptic spike."
