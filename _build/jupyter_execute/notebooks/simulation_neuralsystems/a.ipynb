On its own, this only means that the neuron cannot spike in this period (see below), but doesn't change how ``v`` behaves.

Since the refractory period is now 15 ms this means that the neuron won't be able to spike again until time 8 + 15 = 23 ms. Immediately after the first spike, the value of ``v`` now instantly starts to rise because we didn't specify ``(unless refractory)`` in the definition of ``dv/dt``. However, once it reaches the value 0.8 (the dashed green line) at time roughly 8 ms it doesn't fire a spike even though the threshold is ``v>0.8``.
