    "## A scientific theory?\n",
    "The word \"theory\" has more than one meaning. How do we define A theory? First, it can mean a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained. Examples are Darwin's theory of evolution ([Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism)) or Newton's [Theory of gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity). Second, a set of principles on which the practice of an activity is based: \"a theory of education\" and \"music theory\". Third, an idea used to account for a situation or justify a course of action: \"my theory would be that the place has been seriously mismanaged\". The latter is closest what is often associated with a scientific theory. It can explain an observation and it can be rejected if it is wrong."

    "## Level of details when building a model\n",
    "When building a model we are faced with a dilemma. How much of the experimental observations should we include in the model? There is certainly a temptation to include many experimental observations, especially if they have been difficult to obtain. There is also a common belief in neuroscience that the more details there are included in a model, the better that model is. Nevertheless, bringing in more details also make a model more difficult to understand. If the model has a certain behavior, it is more difficult to disentangle this behavoir and identify the critical components in the model, which is responsible for the behavior. For this reason, it is beneficial to start with a very simple model, and if need be, gradually include more details. It is also important not to include experimental observations, when the importance of of these is unknown. Bringin in an arbitrary observation, while not knowning the significance of this obsertation, is likely to introduce a bias. This could for instance be a conncetion in a network model, while not knowing what other connections are not included. Hence, this single connection will have arbitrary weight, while other connections could be much more important. In physics, it is a virtue to make a model as simple as possible, to better be able to pinpoint the mechanisms.\n",

In some cases we do not want details, if for example, we just want to travel on a highway from one big city to another. In other cases, we want details, if we are to find a specific location.
