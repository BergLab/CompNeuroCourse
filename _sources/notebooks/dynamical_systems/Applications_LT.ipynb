    "In week 1 we learnt the basics of algebra, now we are going to see how these concepts we learn such vector, matrix or eigenvalues can be useful to study dynamical systems. Giving us a complentary view to that of differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to describe a structure that has multiple components with a single vector.  If that structure is changing in time due to some process, it is typical to refer to the vector as a **state vector** since it describes the *state* of the structure at some particular time. To be less abstract, an example would be if you want to quantify the concentration of different neurotransmitters in a synaptic cleft: you could represent the concentration of each of them as a value in a vector. Equivalently, if you are studying the movement of an animal, you could represent the position of each of animal joint as value in the vector so you can track its movement during an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite common to model such dynamic processes at discrete times and use linear transformations to model the evolution of the state vector from one time to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose that we aim to describe sequence of vectors at times $t=0, 1, 2, 3,$... with state vectors $X_0$, $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$.... at those times.  We propose to calculate the state vector $X_t$ based only on the previous state vector $X_{t-1}$.  If we model the transition from $X_{t-1}$ to $X_t$ with a linear transformation, then there is a matrix such that $X_t = AX_{t-1}$.  This sort of model is known as a **discrete dynamical system** and is used in many areas from economics to biology.\n",
    "Although the underlying phenomena —eg. the movement of the animal articulations or chemical concentrations— may change continuously, any experimental measures will always be discrete and hence we need discrete models."

    "#### Infectious Disease Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we consider a basic model of an infectious disease that is spreading within a population.  A well known family of models for this scenario is known as the $SIR$ models.  The acronym comes from a basic modeling assumption that the population is divided into three categories: Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered.  As the disease, spreads a portion of the Susceptible individuals become Infectious, and a portion of Infectious individuals become Recovered.  We will consider a small variation in the model which assumes that a portion of Recovered individuals return to the Susceptible category.  This variation, known as an $SIRS$ model, would be a more accurate description of a disease which can be contracted multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suppose that the population is completely homogeneous in all regards, so that all individuals in a given category have the same probabilities to move to the next category.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model real-world epidemics, it is necessary to estimate some parameters that specify how quickly individuals move among the categories.  These parameters will be important in making any predictions with the model.  For our demonstration, we will create an example.  Let us suppose that our state vectors describe the population at time intervals of 1 week, and that every week, 5% of the Susceptible population becomes Infectious, and 20% of the Infectious population becomes Recovered.  We also suppose that 15% of the Recovered population again becomes Susceptible every week.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we let $s_t$, $i_t$, and $r_t$ represent the percentage of the three categories of the population at time $t$, we can write equations based on the modeling assumptions that allows us to calculate the values based on $s_{t-1}$, $i_{t-1}$, and $r_{t-1}$"

    "Based on the calculation it appears that the state of the population has reached an *equilibrium* after 20 weeks.  In the equilibrium state, each category of the population, $S$, $I$, and $R$, have as many individuals entering the category as leaving it.  In terms of the matrix equation, if $X$ is the vector that contains the equilibrium values of $s_t$, $i_t$, and $r_t$, then $X$ must be a solution to the equation $AX=X$, since $X_{t-1}=X_t$ when the components not changing.  The equation $AX=X$ implies that $X$ is an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to an eigenvalue of one. If you remember the geometrical interpretation of a matrix as a linear transformation in [3Blue1Brown eigenvectors and eigenvalues video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g), the eigenvectors are the vectors who experience scaling by a factor of its eigenvalue but do not experience any change of direction. In other words, if we have a vector $X$ that verifies $AX=X$, that vector $X$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with a corresponding eigenvalue $1$. That means that applying the matrix $A$ —which we can see as a geometrical transformation— does not affect the vector at all. This is why if we find an vector $X$ that verifies $AX=X$, we know the values of $X$ are an equilibrium point of the system!\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation $AX=X$ represents a linear system, even though it is not written in the typical form.  We can rearrange it to look more familiar by using the tools of matrix algebra.  The key is to recognize that $X$ can be written as $IX$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.  This gives $AX=IX$, which can be rewritten as $(A-I)X = 0$.  This matrix equation is the type with which we have been working throughout the previous chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before attempting to solve the system $(A-I)X = 0$, we first recognize it as a Homogeneous Systems and apply some reasoning based on our knowledge of linear systems.  We know that the solution set of a homogeneous system certainly contains the trivial solution $X=0$.  Therefore if there is also a nonzero solution to $(A-I)X=0$, the system must have an infinite number of solutions since linear systems always have zero, exactly one, or an infinite number of solutions.  If the system $(A-I)X=0$ does not have a unique solution there must be a free variable.\n",
