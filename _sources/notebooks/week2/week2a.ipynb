    "It will not come as a surprise: the basic unit of study in neuroscience is the neuron. The neuron acts as the epistemological center of gravity around which all modelling scales orbit. Neurons are specialised cells that possess an electrically excitable membrane and whose main purpose is integrating and transmitting information. They can present very different morphologies, each endowing them of distinct computational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their homeostatic state, neuron membranes observe a potential of $\\sim -70mV$ between the interior and the exterior of the cell; in this state the cell is said to be polarised. Neurons' electric excitability arises from the presence of ion channels and ion pumps in their membranes. Ion channels are proteins that regulate the flux of ions between the inside and outside of the cell. By doing so, they enable neurons to communicate: when positively charged ions enter the cell they reduce the membrane potential, a process referred as depolarisation. If the depolarisation reaches a threshold, it will trigger a positive feedback by which more ion channels are opened and the neuron generates an electric binary signal referred to as *spike* or *action potential*. Spikes are pulse-like currents that constitute the fundamental unit of communication between neurons. When a spike reaches the postsynaptic axon terminal, it dissolves the vesicles containing neurotransmitters, releasing them into the postsynaptic cleft.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the influx of ions into the postsynaptic neuron is positively charged, we talk about excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), conversely, an influx of negatively charged ions that will further polarise the cell is referred to as an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Whether a presynaptic neuron generates EPSPs or IPSPs depends on its neurotransmitter profile which will determine which ion channels open up and, hence, if we have an inhibitory -i.e. polarizing- current (negatively-charged ions) or a excitatory -i.e. depolarizing- current (positively-charged ions). The neurotransmitter profile of a neuron -ie. if it releases inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitters when activated- determine its inhibitory/excitatory nature and, along with its morphology, determines the computational properties of the neuron. In our computational models, we abstract the notion of inhibitory/excitatory synapses by negative/positive weights in the connectivity matrix of the neural population. For the spiking models these connectivity weights have Volt units [V], reflecting how much the membrane potential of the post-synaptic neuron is decreased/increased when the pre-synaptic neuron is activated; for rate-based models, the connectivity has hertz units [Hz], indicating how much the firing rate of the post-synaptic neuron  decreases/increases when the pre-synaptic neuron is activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both chemical and electrical synapses are modelled in the same fashion: as a set of coupled non-linear differential equations capturing the activity of the ion channels. "

    "#### Point-neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of the activations between two neurons require taking into account the distribution of ion-channels across the different sections of the membrane surface as well as the morphology of the membrane itself. This results in  non-linear differential models which are highly faithful but significantly complex.\n",
    "An useful abstraction is to consider neurons to be point-like, that is, disregarding the spatial properties of the cell membrane similarly to the point particle approximation in physics. In point neurons, dendrites are abstracted into the connectivity the neuron. This abstraction is often used in computational neuroscience but has its limitations, for instance, neurons have been shown to perform crucial computations on their dendrites. Throughout this week and next week exercises, we will restrict our models to point-neurons."

If the cumulative sum of PSPs crosses a threshold then the neuron fires a spike. This model can be described with a differential equation used to characterise an electrical RC circuit where the cell membrane acts as a capacitor insulating the conductive intra-cellular and extra-cellular fluids; $V$ is the membrane potential, $I(t)$ is the sum of ionic input currents from presynaptic neurons and $C_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance. It is the ability of the cell membrane to accumulate charges over time that enables the neuron to integrate inputs over time and therefore it is able to perform computations.\n",

However, IF models do not intrinsically give rise to spikes, instead, a firing-threshold mechanism is added *ad hoc* to generate spikes once the defined threshold is reached and subsequently reset the membrane voltage to its resting value.\n",
