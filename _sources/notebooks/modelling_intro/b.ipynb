    "In the previous section we have modelled the activity of a single neuron using a single differential equation. What if we want to model the activity of systems with several interacting elements —like a population of neurons? In this case we will need to introduce at least one differential equation per system component. That is, if we have a population of 10 neurons connected to each other —*coupled*—, we will need at least 10 differential equations to model the whole network activity: we say then that we have a *system of coupled differential equations*. In the chapter *Simulation of neural population*, we will do precisely so; but first, let us have a short break from neurons and look at another coupled system\n",

    "Predator-prey models are a popular model to describe how species intreractions in ecosystems. Species compete, evolve and disperse simply for the purpose of seeking resources to sustain their struggle for their very existence. Depending on their specific settings of applications, they can take the forms of resource-consumer, plant-herbivore, parasite-host, tumor cells (virus)-immune system, susceptible-infectious interactions, etc. They deal with the general loss-win interactions and hence may have applications outside of ecosystems. When seemingly competitive interactions are carefully examined, they are often in fact some forms of predator-prey interaction in disguise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the predator–prey equations, are a pair of first-order, non-linear, autonomous* differential equations. They are frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. You can read more about this from Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka-Volterra_equation>.\n",

    "*Autonomous system or autonomous differential equation is a system of ordinary differential equations which does not explicitly depend on the independent variable, typically dynamical systems are autonomous if the state of the system does not **explicitly** depend on the time $t$.*"
