The ability to use of NumPy therefore will be crucial, while the understanding of Matplotlib is not explicitly required to engage with the content of the guide.  The Matplotlib demonstration below also contains more complex details that might be difficult to digest until the reader gains some experience with Python.  For these reasons, The reader may choose to skip the introduction to Matplotlib and return at a later point if interest arises. \n",
