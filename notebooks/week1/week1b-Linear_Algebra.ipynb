These operations produce other vectors in the collection and they satisfy a list of algebraic requirements such as associativity and commutativity.  Although we will not consider the implications of each requirement here, we provide the list for reference.\n",

    "The most familar example of vector spaces are the collections of single column arrays that we have been referring to as \"vectors\" throughout the previous chapter.  The name given to the collection of all $n\\times 1$ arrays is known as Euclidean $n$-space, and is given the symbol $\\mathbb{R}^n$.  The required definitions of addition and scalar multiplication in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are those described for matrices in [Matrix Algebra](Matrix_Algebra.ipynb).

    "Some of the most important applications of inner products involve finding and using sets of vectors that are mutually orthogonal.  A set of nonzero vectors $\\{U_1, U_2, U_3 ... U_n\\}$ is **mutually orthogonal** if $U_i\\cdot U_j = 0$ whenever $i \\neq j$.  This simply means that every vector in the set is orthogonal to every other vector in the set.  If a set of vectors is mutually orthogonal *and* every vector in the set is a *unit vector*, we say the set is **orthonormal**.  In other words, every vector in an orthonormal set has magnitude one, and is orthogonal to every other vector in the set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Orthonormal sets must be linearly independent, so it makes sense to think of them as a basis for some vector subspace.  Any collection of vectors from the standard bases of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are orthonormal sets.  For example, the set of vectors $\\{E_1, E_4, E_5\\}$ from the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ forms a orthonormal basis for a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n",

    "In this section we will focus on a process called orthogonalization.  Given a set of linearly independent vectors  $\\{V_1, V_2, V_3 ...

In other words, we want both sets to be bases for the same subspace.\n",

    "One of the primary advantages of using orthonormal bases is that the calculation of coordinate vectors is greatly simplified.  Recall that if we have a typical basis $\\beta = \\{V_1, V_2, V_3 ...

This requires that we solve the linear system $A[X]_{\\beta}=X$, where $A$ is the matrix that has the basis vectors as its columns, and $[X]_\\beta$ is the coordinate vector.  If instead we have an orthonormal basis $\\alpha = \\{U_1, U_2, U_3 ... U_n\\}$ for $\\mathcal{V}$, there is a convenient shortcut to solving $X = b_1U_1 + b_2U_2 + ... b_nU_n$.
