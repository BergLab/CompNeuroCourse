    "In neuroscience, we are surrounded by data — from spike waveforms to imaging volumes, from behavioral readouts to connectomic maps. The sheer quantity of it is both a gift and a curse. How do we make sense of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **Machine Learning (ML)** comes in. It provides us with mathematical tools to **extract patterns**, **classify**, **predict**, and ultimately **gain insight** from our data without explicitly coding every rule.\n",

    "- Understand what machine learning is (and isn't)\n",
    "- Learn about the three major categories of ML\n",
    "- Discuss how ML applies to neuroscience research\n",
    "- Cover key terminology like \"features\", \"labels\", and \"loss\"\n",
    "- Replace examples using flower petal datasets with biologically-inspired synthetic neuron data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not dive into code in this chapter, but rather set the **theoretical foundations** for what follows."

    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** is the science (and art) of teaching computers to learn from data. Rather than coding explicit instructions, we give a machine data and ask it to figure out the underlying structure — so that it can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\n",
