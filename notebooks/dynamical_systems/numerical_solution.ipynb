    "# Solving differential equations: Numerical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations can often be solved using a mathematical approach, which is called \"analytical solution\". This requires good skills in math, as a minimum. Some differential equations are not even possible to solve analytically. Therefore it is very useful to be able to solve differential equations using an approximation and a computer. That is called a \"numerical solution\" or solving the equation numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The forward Euler's method: The simple but imprecise method.\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional differential equation written in a general form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x,t)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ is some variable, e.g. the firing rate of a neuron,\n",
    "- $t$ is time \n",
    "- $dx/dt$, is the rate of change of $x$ and is equal to  $f()$ is some function of both $x$ and $t$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve a differential equation, there must be an *Initial Value* that is used to calculate the change. This introduces an interesting property of differential equations: The values of the variables (in this case it is $x$) are different depending on the initial value, but the equation that governs the values is the same. Let us call the initial value of $x$, i.e. the value at $t=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_o = x(t=0) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although time and $x$ are continuous variables, we will approximate their values at descrete times, $t_n = n\\Delta t$, where $n$ indicates the $n$th point and $n\\Delta t$ is the associated time point.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "x_n = x(t_n=n\\Delta t)\n",

    "Now we approximate the differential equation above as the rate of change in the time window of consideration, $\\Delta t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{x_{n+1}-x_n}{\\Delta t} = f(x_n,t_n)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "x_{n+1} = x_{n}+\\Delta t \\frac{dx}{dt}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the slope $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ is corresponding to the time point $t_n$. These iterative equationas are approximation, which is more correct if $f(x_n,t_n)$ is more linear. Also, choosing a smaller $\\Delta t$ increase the accuracy of the update, but this requires more updates for the same amount of time. The accuracy can be estimated to an *order* of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Accuracy \\sim \\frac{\\Delta t}{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $T$ is the timescale of change of $f$. So ideally $\\Delta t$ is small compared with the rate of change of $T$. If not, then the approximation quickly breaks down. As we will discuss below, there is a much better estimation method called 4th order Runge-Kutta, which has an accuracy of $(\\frac{\\Delta t}{T})^4$, i.e. 10 000 time better than the forward Euler method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using for-loop to solve numerically\n",
    "Since the forward Euler method is an iterative process, i.e. calculating the updates in $x$ as $x_{n+1} = x_{n}+f(x_n,t_n)\\Delta t$, it makes sense to use a *for loop*. A for loop in Python is a control structure used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and repeat a block of code for each item in that sequence. The basic syntax of a for loop is the following:\n",
