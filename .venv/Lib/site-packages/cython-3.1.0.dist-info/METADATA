The Cython language makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
easy as Python itself.  Cython is a source code translator based on Pyrex_,
but supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.

The Cython language is a superset of the Python language (almost all Python
code is also valid Cython code), but Cython additionally supports optional
static typing to natively call C functions, operate with C++ classes and
declare fast C types on variables and class attributes.  This allows the
compiler to generate very efficient C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for writing glue code for external
C/C++ libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of
Python code.

The newest Cython release can always be downloaded from https://cython.org/.
Unpack the tarball or zip file, enter the directory, and then run::

    pip install .

Note that for one-time builds, e.g. for CI/testing, on platforms that are not
covered by one of the wheel packages provided on PyPI *and* the pure Python wheel
that we provide is not used, it is substantially faster than a full source build
to install an uncompiled (slower) version of Cython with::

    NO_CYTHON_COMPILE=true pip install .

3.1.0 (2025-05-08)
==================

Features added
--------------

3.1.0 rc 2 (2025-05-07):

* Declarations for C++ ``std::stop_token`` were added as ``libcpp.stop_token`` to provide
  additional low-level synchronisation primitives also in the light of free-threading Python.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6820)

* The generation of the shared module now happens automatically from ``cythonize()`` in a
  ``setuptools`` build if a corresponding ``Extension`` has been configured.
  This avoids an additional step outside of the ``setup.py`` or ``pip wheel`` run.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6842)

3.1.0 rc 1 (2025-05-01):

* ``cython.pymutex`` provides a fast mutex by wrapping the new ``PyMutex`` feature of recent
  CPython versions (including free-threading) and falls back to ``PyThread`` locks in older Pythons.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6579)

* A new directive ``subinterpreters_compatible=shared_gil/own_gil`` was added to allow modules
  to declare support for subinterpreters.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6513)

* ``divmod()`` is also optimised for C floating point types and can be called on C number types
  without holding the GIL.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6801)

* New C++ declarations were added.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6625, https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6731)

* Some common Cython-internal code (currently only memoryview related) can now be extracted
  into a shared extension module to reduce the installed overall size of a package with many
  Cython compiled modules.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2356)

* The type of ``prange`` loop targets is now inferred.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6585)

  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6744)

* Method calls use ``PyObject_VectorcallMethod()`` where possible.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6747)

* Some C-API shortcuts were (re-)added.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6761)

* Cython can avoid normalising exceptions in an `except` clause if it knows that they are unused.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6601)

  benchmarks against different Cython git revisions.

3.1.0 alpha 1 (2024-11-08):

* Support for freethreading builds of CPython 3.13 was added.
  It comes with a new directive ``freethreading_compatible=True`` to mark modules as
  free-threading compatible (``Py_mod_gil``).

  https://github.com/cython/cython/issues?q=label%3A%22nogil+CPython%22

  Patches by Lysandros Nikolaou and Nathan Goldbaum.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6162)

* Support for monitoring Cython modules via `sys.monitoring` in CPython 3.13+ was added.
  For coverage reporting, this needs to be disabled with `-DCYTHON_USE_SYS_MONITORING=0`
  as long as `coverage.py` does not support `sys.monitoring` for coverage plugins.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6144)

  the same as ``typing.Optional[SomeType]``, allowing ``None`` in type checks.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6254)

* ``cython.const[]`` and ``cython.volatile[]`` are now available as type modifiers in Python code.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5728)

  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5804)

* Coroutines now use the ``am_send`` slot function instead of going through a Python ``.send()`` call.
  This has been backported for Python 3.7 - 3.9.
  (Github issues https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4585)

* ``__set_name__`` is called when assigning to class attributes.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6179)

  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3277)

* ``x in ()`` and similar tests against empty constant sequences (e.g. in generated code)
  are now discarded if they have no side-effects.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6288)

* Constant (non-GC) Python objects are no longer traversed with ``Py_VISIT()`` during GC runs.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6277)

* C++ classes implemented in Cython can now use method overloading.
  Patch by samaingw.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3235)

Bugs fixed
----------

3.1.0 rc 2 (2025-05-07):

* Variables typed as builtin Python exception types now accept subtypes instead of rejecting them.
  This specifically impacted types like ``BaseException``, ``Exception`` or ``OSError``,
  which almost always intend to reference subtypes.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6828)

* Functions with more than 10 constant default argument values could generate invalid C code.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6843)

* The ``call_once()`` function argument in ``libc.threads`` (new in 3.1) was changed to require
  a ``nogil`` declaration, as semantically implied.  Code that used it with a callback function
  expecting to hold the GIL must change the callback code to use ``with gil``.

* Calling cimported C functions with their fully qualified package name could crash Cython.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6551)

  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6786)

* Raising ``UnboundLocalError`` could fail for non-ascii variable names.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6800)

* The signature of ``PyByteArray_Resize()`` in ``cpython.bytearray`` failed to propagate exceptions.

  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6815)

3.1.0 beta 1 (2025-04-03):

* Many issues with the Limited C-API and free-threading Python were resolved.
  This includes better thread-safety of Cython-internal types like functions and generators.

  https://github.com/cython/cython/issues?q=label%3A%22limited+api%22

  https://github.com/cython/cython/issues?q=label%3A%22nogil+CPython%22

* ``for-in`` loops could generate invalid code for C++ containers.
  Patch by Taras Kozlov.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6578)

* ``PyDict_GetItemRef()`` and ``PyList_GetItemRef()`` were not always used correctly.

  than Python functions.  They now use the line and column of their first decorator
  or (if none) their definition line, as in Python.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6366)

* Dataclasses did not handle default fields without init value correctly.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5858)

  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6122)

* A crash on exception deallocations was fixed.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6022)

* A crash was fixed when assigning a zero-length slice to a memoryview.
  Patch by Michael Man.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6227)

* ``libcpp.optional.value()`` could crash if it raised a C++ exception.
  Patch by Alexander Condello.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6190)

* The return type of ``str()`` was mishandled, leading to crashes with ``language_level=3``.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6166)

* ``bytes.startswith/endswith()`` failed for non-bytes substrings (e.g. ``bytearray``).
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6168)

* Fused ctuples crashed Cython.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6068)

* A compiler crash was fixed when using extension types in fused types.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6204)

* The module cleanup code was incorrect for globally defined memory view slices.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6276)

* Some adaptations were made to enable compilation in Python 3.13.

Other changes
-------------

3.1.0 rc 1 (2025-05-01):

* Named ``cpdef enums`` no longer copy their item names into the global module namespace.
  This was considered unhelpful for named enums which already live in their own class namespace.
  In cases where the old behaviour was desired, users can add the following backwards compatible
  command after their enum class definition: ``globals().update(TheUserEnumClass.__members__)``.
  Anonymous enums still produce global item names, as before.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4571)

3.1.0 beta 1 (2025-04-03):

* All Cython-internal types (functions, coroutines, …) are now heap types and use type specs.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6633)

* Tracing/monitoring is now disabled in parallel/prange sections.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6709)

* The ``numpy.math`` cimport module has been deprecated.
  Usages should be replaced by ``libc.math``.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6743)

* Includes all fixes as of Cython 3.0.12.

3.1.0 alpha 1 (2024-11-08):

* Support for Python 2.7 - 3.7 was removed, along with large chunks of legacy code.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2800)

* The pxd files ``cpython.int``, ``cpython.cobject``, ``cpython.oldbuffer`` and ``cpython.string``
  were removed as they refer to C-API declarations that are only in Python 2.x.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5870)

* The generated C code now requires a C99 compatible C compiler.

* ``language_level=3`` is now the default.
  ``language_level=3str`` has become a legacy alias.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5827)

* The Py2 types ``unicode`` and ``basestring`` are now deprecated and have become aliases
  of the ``str`` type.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6374)

* Docstrings now strip their leading whitespace according to PEP-257.
  Patch by Lawrence Mitchell.  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6241)

* Type checkers should have it easier to find and validate Cython types in .py files.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/4327)

* The previously shipped NumPy C-API declarations (``cimport numpy``) were removed.
  NumPy has been providing version specific declarations for several versions now.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5842)

* Usages of the outdated ``WITH_THREAD`` macro guard were removed.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/5812)

* The options for showing the C code line in Python exception stack traces were cleaned up.
  Previously, disabling the option with the ``CYTHON_CLINE_IN_TRACEBACK`` macro did not
  reduce the code overhead of the feature, and the ``c_line_in_traceback`` compile option
  was partly redundant with the C macro switches and lead to warnings about unused code.
  Since this is considered mostly a debug feature, the new default is that it is _disabled_
  to avoid code and runtime overhead.  It can be enabled by setting the C macro to 1, and
  a new macro ``CYTHON_CLINE_IN_TRACEBACK_RUNTIME`` was added that controls the runtime
  configurable setting if the feature is enabled, which was previously only available
  through the compile option.  The compile option is now deprecated (but still available),
  and users should migrate to using the two C macros only.
  (Github issue https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/6036)

* Includes all fixes as of Cython 3.0.11 (but generates C99 code in some places).
